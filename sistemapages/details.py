    st.write("This project was initiated to address the challenge of finding a system compatible with our production flow. The company's sales rely on supplier stock, but we do not engage in dropshipping. It was also crucial that the system supports the financial health of the company. Therefore, we developed a simplified system to minimize costs, with customization options as needed. The comprehensive system includes all production stages, from purchasing to product production and cost/sales reporting. We previously struggled with information organization and expense tracking, leading to losses and difficulties in setting growth targets and managing cash flow. In my portfolio, I offer an overview of the system for easier understanding. It's worth noting that the entire system is hosted on an Amazon AWS EC2 instance. I am available to answer any questions.")

Initially, the proposal card is populated with products, their prices, and quantities. Following this, a task of the 'Proposal' type is created, alongside a proposal number - in this instance, I used 'Test'. Subsequently, the completed proposal is saved to the OneDrive page of the assigned team member. The PowerPoint proposal contains all the data that has been entered into the CRM up to that point.")
